Handwritten -digit prediction using Clasification techniques
Title of Project
Handwritten Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis

Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict handwritten digits.

Data Source
The dataset used for this project is the "digits" dataset from scikit-learn's built-in datasets. It contains images of handwritten digits, where each image is an 8x8 pixel matrix, and the target variable represents the actual digit value (0-9).
